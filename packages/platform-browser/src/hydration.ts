/**
 * Sets up providers necessary to enable hydration functionality for the application.

 * `provideClientHydration` function.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * Basic example of how you can enable hydration in your application when
 * `bootstrapApplication` function is used:
 *
 * ```
 * bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
 *   providers: [provideClientHydration()]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively if you are using NgModules, you would add `provideClientHydration`
 * to your root app module's provider list.
 *
 * ```
 * @NgModule({
 *   declarations: [RootCmp],
 *   bootstrap: [RootCmp],
 *   providers: [provideClientHydration()],
 * })
 * export class AppModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * @see `withNoDomReuse`
 * @see `withNoHttpTransferCache`
 * @param features Optional features to configure additional router behaviors.
 *
 * 配置其他路由器行为的可选特性。
 *
 * @returns A set of providers to enable hydration.
