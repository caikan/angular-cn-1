/**
 * @fileoverview
 * A module to facilitate use of a Trusted Types policy within the JIT
 * compiler. It lazily constructs the Trusted Types policy, providing helper
 * utilities for promoting strings to Trusted Types. When Trusted Types are not
 * available, strings are used as a fallback.
 * @security All use of this module is security-sensitive and should go through
 * security review.
 */

import {global} from '../util';

/**
 * While Angular only uses Trusted Types internally for the time being,
 * references to Trusted Types could leak into our core.d.ts, which would force
 * anyone compiling against @angular/core to provide the @types/trusted-types
 * package in their compilation unit.
 *
 * 虽然 Angular 暂时仅在内部使用受信任类型，但对受信任类型的引用可能会泄漏到我们的 core.d.ts
 * 中，这将迫使任何针对 @angular/core 编译的人在他们的编译单元中提供 @types/trusted-types 包.
 *
 * Until https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30024 is resolved, we
 * will keep Angular's public API surface free of references to Trusted Types.
 * For internal and semi-private APIs that need to reference Trusted Types, the
 * minimal type definitions for the Trusted Types API provided by this module
 * should be used instead. They are marked as "declare" to prevent them from
 * being renamed by compiler optimization.
 *
 * 在解决 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30024 之前，我们将保持 Angular 的公共 API
 * 图面不存在对受信任类型的引用。对于需要引用受信任类型的内部和半私有
 * API，应改为使用此模块提供的受信任类型 API
 * 的最小类型定义。它们被标记为“declare”，以防止它们被编译器优化重命名。
 *
 * Adapted from
 * https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/trusted-types/index.d.ts
 * but restricted to the API surface used within Angular.
 *
 * 改编自 https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/trusted-types/index.d.ts
